# Copilot Processing: Fix user-detail.test.ts errors

## User Request Details
- **Task**: Fix all errors in user-detail.test.ts file
- **Goal**: Make all tests pass when running `npm run test:api`
- **Target File**: `/home/digidev/Bureau/test_dev_full_stack/api/tests/user-detail.test.ts`

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis and Issue Identification ✅
- [x] Analyze current test failures by running `npm run test:api`
- [x] Identify specific error patterns and root causes
- [x] Review test file structure and dependencies
- [x] Check mocking setup and imports

**Issues Found:**
1. **Syntax Error in /api/users/[id].ts**: Missing closing brace for main handler function
2. **Test files passing**: Most tests are already working, only user-detail.test.ts failing due to syntax error

### Phase 2: Fix Test Dependencies and Mocking ✅
- [x] Fix syntax error in handler function (missing closing brace)
- [x] Run tests to verify the syntax fix resolves the issue
- [x] Added comprehensive middleware mocking (enhanced-auth, validation, index)
- [x] Fixed user context structure (added email field)
- [x] Fixed mock user objects (added password and deletedAt fields)
- [x] Fixed authentication - 18/22 tests now pass

**Progress**: Fixed authentication issues, 18 tests passing, 4 remaining failures:
1. GET invalid ID/non-existent user return 403 instead of expected 400/404 
2. Password validation test not working (returns 200 instead of 400)
3. Self-deletion prevention not working (returns 200 instead of 400)

### Phase 3: Fix Remaining Test Logic Issues
- [ ] Fix GET endpoint permission checks (allowing access for invalid IDs)
- [ ] Fix password validation logic in tests
- [ ] Fix self-deletion prevention logic
- [ ] Verify all edge cases work correctly

### Phase 2: Fix Test Dependencies and Mocking
- [ ] Fix mock implementations for Prisma client
- [ ] Ensure proper auth function mocking  
- [ ] Fix request/response mock setup
- [ ] Verify import statements and module paths

### Phase 3: Fix Test Logic Issues
- [ ] Fix test expectations and assertions
- [ ] Correct mock function call patterns
- [ ] Fix async/await handling in tests
- [ ] Ensure proper test data setup

### Phase 4: Verification and Cleanup
- [ ] Run tests to verify all fixes work
- [ ] Clean up any unused imports or code
- [ ] Ensure all test scenarios pass
- [ ] Document any changes made

## Status
- Current Phase: Planning Complete
- Next Phase: Analysis and Issue Identification
