## Next Steps for Manual Setup

Since some GitHub APIs are not available through automation tools:

### Create GitHub Project Board (Manual)

1. Go to <https://github.com/Tanimou/user-management-system/projects>
2. Create new project board with columns:
   - **Backlog** (Epic #1, Features #2-5)
   - **Ready** (Stories ready for development)
   - **In Progress** (Active development)
   - **Review** (Code review and testing)
   - **Done** (Completed and deployed)
3. Add all 26 issues to the project board
4. Set up automation rules for issue/PR state changes

### Development Workflow

1. Start with Epic #1 and break down into sprints
2. Prioritize Authentication & Security (#2) as first feature
3. Use issues as development tasks with clear acceptance criteria
4. Each issue contains full technical specifications and testing requirements

## Summary

✅ **Successfully completed**: Git repository initialization, GitHub repository creation, and comprehensive GitHub issue creation (26 issues total)  
✅ **All requested elements delivered**: Epic, features, user stories, technical enablers with full project information  
✅ **Ready for development**: Issues contain detailed specifications, acceptance criteria, and technical requirements  
✅ **Project structure established**: Clear hierarchy from Epic → Features → Stories/Enablers with dependencies documented

The user management system project is now fully organized on GitHub with comprehensive issue tracking ready for agile development workflow.
