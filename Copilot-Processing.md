# Copilot Processing: Fix Login Issue After Folder Restructure

## User Request Details

- **Task**: Fix login functionality that broke after moving folders out of api/
- **Goal**: Restore login functionality and fix all import path issues
- **Issue**: User cannot login anymore since lib, scripts, tests folders were moved from api/ to root level

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation âœ…

- [x] Analyze login endpoint and current error messages
- [x] Check browser console for specific errors
- [x] Identify which imports are broken after folder restructure

**Issues Found:**

1. **Import Path Issues**: Login endpoint likely references moved lib/auth.ts with wrong path
2. **Module Resolution**: Serverless functions may not be finding auth utilities
3. **Console Errors**: Multiple 500 Internal Server Errors visible in browser

### Phase 2: Fix Import Paths (In Progress)

- [ ] Update login endpoint import paths to reference lib/ at root level
- [ ] Fix auth middleware import paths
- [ ] Update all API handlers to use correct lib/ paths
- [ ] Verify Prisma client imports are working

### Phase 3: Test and Verify

- [ ] Test login functionality works
- [ ] Verify refresh token endpoint
- [ ] Check all authenticated routes work
- [ ] Run API tests to ensure nothing else broke

## Status
- Current Phase: Planning Complete
- Next Phase: Analysis and Issue Identification
