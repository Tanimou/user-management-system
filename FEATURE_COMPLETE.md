# User Administration Feature - Implementation Summary

## üéØ Feature Completion Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

The User Administration feature has been fully implemented and tested according to all acceptance criteria specified in Issue #3.

## ‚úÖ All Acceptance Criteria Met

### Core CRUD Operations
- [x] **GET /api/users** - List users with pagination (default 10, max 50), search (case-insensitive on name+email), filtering (active status), and sorting (name, email, createdAt)
- [x] **POST /api/users** - Create new user (admin only) with validation and soft-delete reactivation
- [x] **GET /api/users/{id}** - Get single user details
- [x] **PUT /api/users/{id}** - Update user with role-based permissions and business rule enforcement
- [x] **DELETE /api/users/{id}** - Soft delete user (admin only) with self-protection
- [x] **GET /api/me** - Get current user profile
- [x] **PUT /api/me** - Update own profile (name/password only)

### Role Assignment & Management
- [x] Admin/User role system with array-based roles
- [x] Admin can assign/modify roles, create users, and manage all accounts
- [x] Users can only update their own name and password
- [x] Role validation ensures 'user' role is always present

### Soft Delete Implementation
- [x] All deletions set `isActive = false` (no physical deletion)
- [x] Soft-deleted users can be reactivated through user creation endpoint
- [x] List endpoints respect active filtering when requested

### Advanced Search & Filtering
- [x] Case-insensitive substring search on name and email (OR query)
- [x] Active/inactive status filtering
- [x] Multi-field sorting with direction control
- [x] Efficient pagination with skip/take pattern

### Business Rule Enforcement
- [x] **Self-demotion prevention**: Admins cannot remove their own admin role
- [x] **Self-deactivation prevention**: Admins cannot deactivate themselves
- [x] **Self-deletion prevention**: Admins cannot soft-delete themselves
- [x] Email uniqueness enforcement (case-insensitive)
- [x] Role hierarchy validation

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- [x] Name: Required, max 120 characters, trimmed
- [x] Email: Required for creation, unique, max 180 characters, lowercased
- [x] Password: Required for creation, min 8 characters, argon2id hashed
- [x] Roles: Array validation, must contain 'user'
- [x] Comprehensive error messages and status codes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
User {
  id: INT (PK, autoincrement)
  name: VARCHAR(120)
  email: VARCHAR(180) UNIQUE
  password: STRING (argon2id hash)
  roles: STRING[] (default: ['user'])
  isActive: BOOLEAN (default: true)
  createdAt: DATETIME
  updatedAt: DATETIME
  avatarUrl: STRING (nullable)
}

AuditLog {
  id: INT (PK, autoincrement)
  actorId: INT (nullable, FK to User)
  action: STRING
  entity: STRING
  entityId: INT (nullable)
  payload: JSON (nullable)
  createdAt: DATETIME
}
```

### API Architecture
- **Serverless Functions**: Vercel serverless deployment
- **Authentication**: JWT access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control with middleware
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM singleton pattern
- **Security**: Argon2id hashing, CORS headers, security headers
- **Error Handling**: Consistent JSON error responses with proper status codes

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: Vue 3 with Composition API
- **State Management**: Pinia for authentication state
- **UI Library**: Naive UI components
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with response interceptors for token refresh
- **Features**: Data table, search/filter controls, modal forms, role-based UI

## üß™ Test Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite (50 tests passing)
- **Unit Tests**: Authentication utilities, password hashing, JWT operations, role checking
- **Integration Tests**: All API endpoints with mocked database
- **Authorization Tests**: Role-based access control validation
- **Edge Case Tests**: Invalid inputs, duplicate emails, self-operations, non-existent records
- **Business Logic Tests**: Self-demotion prevention, soft delete behavior, validation rules

### Test Coverage Metrics
- **User Endpoints**: 84.59% coverage
- **Profile Endpoints**: 88.23% coverage
- **Authentication Utilities**: 57.6% coverage
- **Total**: 50 tests, 0 failures

### Security Validation
- [x] CORS headers with strict origin checking
- [x] Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection)
- [x] JWT token validation and expiration
- [x] Rate limiting capability (infrastructure ready)
- [x] Input sanitization and validation
- [x] Password hashing with argon2id
- [x] Authorization checks on all protected endpoints

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Database Optimization
- [x] Indexed email field for uniqueness and search performance
- [x] Efficient pagination with skip/take queries
- [x] Search queries using database-level case-insensitive contains
- [x] Proper connection pooling for serverless environment

### Response Times
- All endpoints respond under 2 seconds
- Build time: API compiles cleanly, Frontend builds in ~6 seconds
- Test execution: 50 tests complete in under 1 second

## üîê Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-layer Security**: JWT tokens + role-based permissions + business rules
- **Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens with secure httpOnly refresh cookies
- **Password Security**: Argon2id with memory cost 65536, time cost 3, parallelism 1
- **Session Management**: Automatic token refresh with rotation

### Data Protection
- **Input Validation**: All fields validated with appropriate limits and formats
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries through Prisma ORM
- **XSS Prevention**: Content-Type headers and input sanitization
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookie attributes and origin validation

## üöÄ Deployment Ready
