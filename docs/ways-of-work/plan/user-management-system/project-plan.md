# User Management System - GitHub Project Plan

## 1. Project Overview

### Feature Summary

Build a comprehensive user management mini-application with authentication, role-based access control, and data table management. The system provides secure user administration capabilities with JWT-based authentication, soft delete functionality, and advanced filtering/pagination.

### Success Criteria

- **Authentication System**: 99.9% uptime for login/logout flows with <200ms response times
- **Role Management**: 100% enforcement of admin/user permissions with zero privilege escalation incidents
- **Data Management**: Support for 10,000+ users with <1s query response times
- **Security Compliance**: Zero exposed password hashes, secure cookie handling, argon2id encryption
- **User Experience**: <3 clicks to perform any core user management task

### Key Milestones

1. **Foundation Setup**: Core infrastructure, database schema, and authentication system
2. **Backend API**: Complete REST API with all endpoints and security measures
3. **Frontend Application**: Vue 3 SPA with complete user interface and state management
4. **Integration & Testing**: End-to-end testing, security validation, and performance optimization
5. **Deployment & Monitoring**: Production deployment with observability and documentation

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| JWT Security Vulnerabilities | High | Low | Implement refresh token rotation, secure httpOnly cookies |
| Database Performance Issues | Medium | Medium | Implement proper indexing, pagination limits |
| Frontend State Management Complexity | Medium | Low | Use Pinia with clear store patterns |
| Vercel Serverless Cold Starts | Low | High | Implement Prisma client reuse pattern |
