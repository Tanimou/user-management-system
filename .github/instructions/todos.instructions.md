<todos title="Fix Vercel Dev Recursive Invocation Error" agentRequirement="Review steps frequently throughout the conversation and DO NOT stop between steps unless they explicitly require it. Keep the todos updated using the todo_write tool (do not edit this file).">
- [x] investigate-vercel-settings: Check Vercel project settings for Development Command configuration ðŸ”´
  _Found that the error occurs when vercel dev recursively calls itself. Need to identify where this is configured._
- [x] check-package-json-scripts: Examine package.json dev scripts in both root and api directories ðŸ”´
  _Identified that API package.json has 'vercel dev --listen 3001' as dev script, and root package.json workspace dev scripts could be causing the recursion. The issue is that Vercel is trying to run the dev command which calls vercel dev again._
- [x] fix-recursive-config: Remove or fix the recursive vercel dev command configuration ðŸ”´
  _Removed the recursive 'vercel dev --listen 3001' command from API package.json dev script. Now Vercel won't try to call itself recursively._
- [x] test-dev-command: Test the fixed development command to ensure it works properly ðŸŸ¡
  _Successfully resolved both issues: 1) Removed recursive dev script from API package.json, and 2) Updated vercel.json to remove explicit runtime configuration which was causing version errors. Vercel dev is now working correctly and serving the frontend on localhost:3001._
