- [x] fix-api-client-token-storage: Fix API client token management - localStorage/sessionStorage operations ðŸ”´
  _Fixed localStorage/sessionStorage mocks in test setup. The mocks now properly store and retrieve values instead of just being empty vi.fn() functions. All 5 API client token management tests now pass._
- [x] fix-password-strength-meter: Fix PasswordStrengthMeter component rendering and CSS class expectations ðŸŸ¡
  _Fixed CSS class name mismatch in tests. Tests were expecting '.password-strength' but component uses '.password-strength-meter'. Updated test expectations to match component implementation. All 7 PasswordStrengthMeter tests now pass._
- [x] fix-auth-store-login: Fix auth store login functionality and token persistence to localStorage ðŸ”´
  _Fixed auth store login method issues: 1) Used correct password parameter name when calling API (pass instead of password), 2) Fixed token/user extraction from response.data instead of response directly. All 22 auth store tests now pass._
